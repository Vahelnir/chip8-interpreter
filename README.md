# Chip 8 Interpreter

## Why ?

A friend of mine started to implement a Chip8 interpreter, just for fun & to learn things (bitwise operations, parsing, buffers/ArrayBuffer).

It seemed fun so I followed him in this adventure.

Don't look at how the source code is just yet, I just wanted it to be working, and then I will be able to refactor everything !

## Docs used

I used [http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) which is a documentation explaining the basics of the Chip8 display, inputs, the instructions and how they should behave !

[Timendus/chip8-test-suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite) is a test suite which was SO USEFUL !
